        </p>
        <p>
          The KC Stardust Marks are highly valued intellectual property, and
          therefore KC Stardust will take the necessary steps to guard against
          dilution and the use of third-party marks which are confusingly

          Stardust Marks.

          any promise or other representation with respect to KC Stardust Marks
          by a KC Stardust employee in the absence of a formal written agreement
          cannot be relied upon.

          losses, costs, expenses and fees (including reasonable attorneys’
          fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your
          (or anyone using your account, computer or software’s) use of
          kcstardust.com or its affiliated social media outlets or violation of
          these Terms. kcstardust.com reserves the right to assume the exclusive

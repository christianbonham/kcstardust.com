<ul>
    	<li>
	<h3><a href="BLM/story.html">#BlackLivesMatter</a></h3>

	<p>This is a subject that is very important to me. A high impact presentation such as this can be used on a public web page or as an intro to an internal company diversity training. Statistics and bold visuals are intended to capture learner attention and build a desire to learn more.  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><a href="Kids_Game.mp4">Gamified Training</a></h3>

	<p>This is an example of an eLearning designed for the K-5 environment. A distance learning solution was needed that could be easily distributed to students prior to the first day of in-classroom instruction. Faculty wanted students arriving to the school already knowing proper sanitation and health habits so that there was no learning gap. The fun, gamified format was designed to be used easily on tablets and mobile devices, and the colors and graphics were chosen specifically to engage children from K-5. I managed all components of content organization, graphic design, and module development on this project. </p>
	</li>

		<li>
	<h3><a href="tabproject/story.html">Microlearning</a></h3>

	<p>This is an example of a microlearning tab interaction developed in Storyline. Microlearning is a training strategy that uses bite sized learning events to quickly close training gaps without a large time commitment from the learner. Development of a microlearning interaction such as this one can be done rapidly at a very low cost.</p>
	</li>
		<li>
	<h3><a href="E-Learning_Module_Sample_2.mp4">Regulatory Compliance Training</a></h3>

	<p>This is a clinical training that is a requirement for staff who administer hazardous drugs. The dense course material was broken up with interactions and formative assessments to prevent cognitive load. Uniform design ensures learner attention and focus stays on the course content and not extraneous design features.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><a href="E-Learning_Module_Sample_1.mp4">Software Training</a></h3>

	<p>This is a corporate hands-on software simulation developed to train staff on setting up and filling out company expense reports. A simulated instructor was used to help provide a more engaging and memorable experience for this technical training. Articulate 360 was used to develop the simulation using hot spots, and job aids were created for staff to reference for just in time training prior to having to fill out an expense report. The training also included education on company corporate credit card and travel policies, and a summative assessment confirmed retention of that knowledge.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><a href="Project_Proposal_Sample.pdf">Project Plan/Proposal</a></h3>

	<p>A design document developed after the initial project planning meeting with stakeholders. This helps map out project scope, audience, course goals and objectives, as well as design, implementation, assessment, and program evaluation strategies. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><a href="Script-Video_Sample.mp4">Script/Instructional Video</a></h3>

	<p>This is an instructional video developed using Articulate 360 and Camtasia Studio. This is one in a 4 part short video series created for users of the Learning Management System. A script was developed prior to live video recording.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><a href="Storyboard_Screenshot.PNG">Storyboard</a></h3>

	<p>A necessary tool in the iterative design process. A storyboard will help create visuals and describe course functionality so the design can be shopped around to stakeholders and SMEâ€™s prior to beginning the development process. The storyboard also serves as an invaluable roadmap for development when working on a team or on complex projects with specific requirements.
